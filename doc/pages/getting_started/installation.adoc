=== Installation [[installation]]

vim-iced itself and {vim_sexp} are the minimal requirements.

In addition, if there is one of follows, you can use interactive UI for selecting one from multiple candidates (e.g. selecting a ns which you'd like to add)

- https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim[ctrlp.vim]
- https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[fzf]
- https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap[vim-clap]

If anything is okay, ctrlp.vim is easy to install and stable.

==== Installing plugins [[installing_plugins]]

At first, if you don't have a plugin manager, please install https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[vim-plug].

.vim
[source,shell]
----
$ curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
----

.neovim
[source,shell]
----
$ curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
----

Next, add a vim-plug section to your `~/.vimrc` (or `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` for Neovim)

[source,vim]
----
" Specify a directory for plugins
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

" One of following
Plug 'ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim'
Plug 'junegunn/fzf'
Plug 'liuchengxu/vim-clap'

" Requires
Plug 'guns/vim-sexp',    {'for': 'clojure'}
Plug 'liquidz/vim-iced', {'for': 'clojure'}

call plug#end()

" Enable vim-iced's default key mapping
" This is recommended for newbies
let g:iced_enable_default_key_mappings = v:true
----

Then start Vim/Neovim, and execute the following command to install dependent plugins.

[source,vim]
----
:PlugInstall
----

==== iced command [[installation_iced_command]]

`iced` is a a utility command to make you easy to use vim-iced, and it comes with vim-iced.
Setup is easy, just add the `bin` directory under the installed vim-iced directory to `$PATH` environmental variable.
With above vim-plug setting,  `~/.vim/plugged/vim-iced/bin` is the directory to add to `$PATH`.

[source,shell]
----
# For bash or zsh
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/.vim/plugged/vim-iced/bin

# For fish
$ set -x PATH ~/.vim/plugged/vim-iced/bin $PATH
----

To confirm setup, run the following command.

[source,shell]
----
$ iced version
----

See <<iced_command>> for more information.

=== Quick start [[quick_start]]

Let's create a sample project for quick start.
Here https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen[Leiningen] is used to create a project template.

[source,shell]
----
$ lein new hello-iced
$ cd hello-iced
----

We use `iced` command to launch REPL instead of `lein` command.
This allows `iced` command to take care of all the additional libraries and REPL settings you need.

[source,shell]
----
$ iced repl
----

Open vim and execute {help_html}#%3AIcedConnect[IcedConnect] command.

[source,shell]
----
$ vim src/hello_iced/core.clj
----

You succeeded to connect REPL if you see "Connected" message, so let's execute the next command.

[source,vim]
----
:IcedEval (+ 1 2 3 4 5)
----

Do you see `15` as a result?
If so, your vim has started working with Clojure's REPL finally!
