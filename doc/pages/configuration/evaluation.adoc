=== Evaluation [[configuration_evaluation]]

==== Eval inside comment [[eval_inside_comment]]

`comment` form is useful during development for checking behavior.
You can use <<evaluate_outer_list>> range to evaluate codes inside `comment` form,
but it is cumbersome as some cursor movements are required.

{help_html}#%3AIcedEvalOuterTopList[IcedEvalOuterTopList] helps by selecting different code to be evaluated when the current top form is a `comment`.
If the cursor is in a form nested inside the comment, the code to be evaluated will be the cursor's topmost form in the comment, rather than the comment form itself.

When the cursor is otherwise at the same depth as the `comment` form itself, the `comment` will be evaluated as a `do` form.
This can be configured by {help_html}#g%3Aiced%23eval%23inside_comment[g:iced#eval#inside_comment], and it is enabled by default.

.Example (📍 means cursor position)
[source,clojure]
----
(comment
  (print (📍"Hello"))   ;; Execute `:IcedEvalOuterTopList`
  (print ("world")))    ;; => hello

(comment
📍(print ("hello"))     ;; Execute `:IcedEvalOuterTopList`
  (print ("world")))    ;; => helloworld
