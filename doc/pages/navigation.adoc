=== Jump to definition

vim-iced provides {help_html}#%3AIcedDefJump[IcedDefJump] command for jumping to definition.

It is also supported to jump to qualified keywords and local vars.

If you jumped to a definition with above command, vim-iced add the current cursor position to Vim's https://vim-jp.org/vimdoc-en/tagsrch.html#tagstack[tag stack].
So you can go back easily with https://vim-jp.org/vimdoc-en/tagsrch.html#CTRL-T[<C-t>].
