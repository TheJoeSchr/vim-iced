== Testing [[testing]]

vim-iced can integrate with https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.test-api.html[clojure.test], and provides following test commands.

[cols="30,20,50"]
|===
| Command | Default key mapping | Description

| {help_html}#%3AIcedTestAll[IcedTestAll]
| {plug_iced_test_all}
| Run all tests in current project

| {help_html}#%3AIcedTestNs[IcedTestNs]
| {plug_iced_test_ns}
| Run tests in current namespace

| {help_html}#%3AIcedTestUnderCursor[IcedTestUnderCursor]
| `{plug_iced_test_under_cursor}`
| Run a test under cursor +
See also <<related_tests>>

| {help_html}#%3AIcedTestRedo[IcedTestRedo]
| `{plug_iced_test_redo}`
| Re run *failed* tests

| {help_html}#%3AIcedTestRerunLast[IcedTestRerunLast]
| `{plug_iced_test_rerun_last}`
| Run the last test again

|===

=== Test result [[test_result]]

When tests are failed, vim-iced show error messages in <<test_buffer>>,
and {help_html}#%3AIcedTestBufferOpen[IcedTestBufferOpen] command open the buffer.

vim-iced also set error positions to https://vim-jp.org/vimdoc-en/quickfix.html[quickfix],
and https://vim-jp.org/vimdoc-en/quickfix.html#:cwindow[:cwindow] command enables you to show this information.
This is useful to jump each failed tests.

=== Related tests [[related_tests]]

{help_html}#%3AIcedTestUnderCursor[IcedTestUnderCursor] is not just running a test under cursor.

If the var under cursor does not contain `:test` metadata and current namespace doesn't end with "-test",
vim-iced searches test vars in corresponding test namespace (c.f. <<navigation_source_and_test>>) and run them.
Target test vars should include original var name in its name.

=== Checking spec [[testing_checking_spec]]

There is also https://clojure.org/guides/spec#_testing[checking spec] as one of the tests.

{help_html}#%3AIcedTestSpecCheck[IcedTestSpecCheck] command is useful to run `clojure.spec.test.alpha/check` for the function under cursor.

[NOTE]
====
Adding https://github.com/clojure/test.check[test.check] dependency is required.
====

You can specify the number of tests as a command argument,
or {help_html}#g%3Aiced%23test%23spec_num_tests[g:iced#test#spec_num_tests] variable.

=== Testing on plain nREPL [[testing_plain_nrepl]]

[NOTE]
====
https://github.com/borkdude/jet[borkdude/jet] is required currently. +
vim-iced can download `jet` automatically if you want.
====

vim-iced basically requires nREPL with some middlewares.
But in some case, you may need to use plain nREPL such as https://book.babashka.org/#_nrepl[babashka.nrepl].

In this case, vim-iced provides simple test integration which has less
functionality than https://docs.cider.mx/cider-nrepl/nrepl-api/ops.html#test-var-query[cider-nrepl's one].

To use this simple test integration, you don't need to recognize whether your nREPL is plain or not.
Following commands are also support simple test integration, so you just execute these commands as usual.

* {help_html}#%3AIcedTestUnderCursor[IcedTestUnderCursor]
* {help_html}#%3AIcedTestNs[IcedTestNs]
* {help_html}#%3AIcedTestAll[IcedTestAll]

[NOTE]
====
`:IcedTestAll` depends on current namespace.
(e.g. `foo.core` will search all vars in `foo.*`). +
So it's still not really the whole test.
